.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nimdow

or via IPC.

.B nimdow
also acts as a cli client,
which talks to a running nimdow process via a UNIX socket.
All window manager controls are available via the IPC and cli client.
The UNIX socket is created at
.B $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nimdow/ipc-socket.%p
where %p is the PID of nimdow.

Floating windows are supported,
